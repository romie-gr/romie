[Romie](https://github.com/drpaneas/romie/) is a golang project created by some
friends in a way that is a professional environment (some would say overkill)
with CI and CD systems. Its purpose is to teach us golang and to learn how we
can set up CI/CD and other workflows. The purpose of the code will be a
script/program that would allow you to download ROMs from various sites for
[Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/). We want to have fun learning and doing a
fun project. See [here](https://github.com/drpaneas/romie/blob/master/README.md#contributors-)
for the authors and contributors.
